Every time I'm left alone
My misery
Begins to drown me
Tied by a rope
Of anxiety
Thrown overboard
As I'm pulled under the tides
Of this fast-paced world (of this fast paced world)
I refuse to see
The time will always be (the)
The thing that kills me truly (truly)
I'll open these eyes waking (waking)
From a dream feigning (feigning)
My lungs fill up with letdown
Disappointment
In self and everyone
Expectations and failure
Abandonment
My un-savior
As I'm pulled under the tides
Of this fast-paced world (of this fast paced world)
I refuse to see
The time will always be (the)
The thing that kills me truly (truly)
I'll open these eyes, waking (waking)
From a dream feigning (feigning)
Absolution
At the sight of
Your demise
I know what I must do
Choke
Die choking on your every word
Swallow every blasphemy
Absolution at the sight of your demise
I know what I must do
Swallow every blasphemy
Eat out your heart and make it bleed
Tie the noose
Around my neck
Make
This
Life end
