Behold, our beloved revels in tragedy
In tragedy
Self-denying avarice for bloodshed
Behold, hypocrite
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Those who run will be burned
Devoutly wished for blinded eyes
This tragedy's like light to flies
This seems to suit you better
Bleeding out the eyes
Hope's left in chain suspension
Holding onto lies to make the truth
