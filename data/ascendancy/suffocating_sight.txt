I am but a farce, a satire of stability
Insecurity is an uphill struggle
It's me versus the world
The shore still starves for another
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out
My hands shake in apprehension
Of every action
I'm guilty of
Playing the victim
The shore still starves for another
Novel of my shipwrecked being
Tied up, dried, and I'm still breathing
The sands of time, for me, are running out
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you
It's time for your panic
Then it kills
Makes you manic
Making its way inside
Relax it's all right
Making its way inside
Relax it's all right
Panic grips your frantic breathing
I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe!
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
Will surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
Just like the embrace of arms that
Made you
They'll surely destroy you
