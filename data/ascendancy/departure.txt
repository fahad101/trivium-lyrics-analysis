This weight is so unbearable, caving my lungs
All my life seems to be flashing in front of my eyes
Run away from all the pain, all the pain in life
Run away from the pain of life
Ways of devotion turn to obsession; open your eyes
I want you to see what you've done to me
Crying out those eyes
Run away from all the pain, all the pain in life
Run away from the pain of life
Bring my end to an end
Distance yourself from the pain
That covers me
As I reach out for your hand
To find there's nothing left for me
Razors kiss the vein, overdose for pain
A 12-gauge cross kisses the forehead
A savior in a shell
Sever me from the fall
Fuck the people, fuck the world, fuck it all
Open my arms
Bleed out the flood
In crimson, I begin to drown
