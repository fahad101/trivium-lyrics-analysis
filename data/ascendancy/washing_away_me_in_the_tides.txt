Disgusted with what I see
So many pieces left of you and me
Glass falls like rain
I'll crucify you for this pain.....for this pain
Tonight I leave this town
In love I'd burn it all down
To the ground you're nothing to me
To the ground you're fucking killing me
Abandon all hope washing away me in the tides
Unclenching the fists made round my neck accepting the end
Longing to see your face
So my hand can form into a mace
Everything smells of you
Even the gasoline that covers you
