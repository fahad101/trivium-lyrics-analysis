The face
And the lips
Tremble
As it rips
Your breath
Quickening
As he rushes in
Pull harder
Strings martyr
"Stop," you cry
"That's a lie!"
Flush gasping
White reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
Clawing
The skin
Each kill
Your weakness
Annihilation
Your masturbation
Tyrant, I'll burn you down
Pull harder
Strings, martyr
"Stop," you cry
"That's a lie!"
Flush gasping
White reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
My hands grip your throat
I need your end
Burned, staked, ripped apart
I avenge
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay
You ask me, "Oh, God, why?"
Cause I'm God's fucking why
For every life you have taken
I am here to repay
Pull harder
Strings, martyr
"Stop," you cry
"That's a lie!"
Flush gasping
White reddening
You smile and destroy it
It's time that we end this
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
It's our curse that makes this world so hopeless
Allowing our king to spread his genocidal wings
