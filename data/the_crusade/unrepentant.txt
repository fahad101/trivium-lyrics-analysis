A poor man
With four daughters
A wife and a son
Daughter commits adultery
Or so he was told
Bought a knife and machete
After Friday's prayers
Feared the young would follow old
Thought all must be killed
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
Ashamed madman
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take and take their lives away
You're the man unrepentant
Don't you realize
You murdered your own children
Call that honorable cause?
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
Ashamed madman
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take and take their lives away
For your honor
You will slaughter
Every one of your daughters
For your honor
You will slaughter
It's you who should be slaughtered
Terror grips the steel with hunger
Thirsting to avenge its soiled pride
Ashamed madman
You take their lives away as they sleep
The blade kisses at their throats
Life bleeds without a chance to weep
You take and take their lives away
