Stress breaking my back
Pulse is stuttering
Pressure, mental attack
My thoughts cluttering
Beating this dead horse is exhausting
Heartbreaking to see my hands shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead, still wading
Still wading in this This well called "life"
Nervousness halting all will
Forcing apathy
Anxiety an aching chill
Hammering down me
Beating this dead horse is exhausting
Heartbreaking to see my hands shaking
I'm knee-deep in the dead, still wading
Still wading in this This well called "life"
Tread the floods so you can hope to seize
Your own reality
'Fore it escapes thee
Watch yourself drown in disarray
It's time to break away
Or we'll die today
