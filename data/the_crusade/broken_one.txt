Defeat grips you
Life deflates you
Kills your hopes too
You won't make it through
Pick up the pieces
There is a better way
Put yourself together
Try to make a change
This world's so twisted
You can still make a change
Protect and care for the whole world
Stop the spread of hate
You feel like the broken one
Over and over again
You taste blood, you're through, you're done!
Only you can make it end
Can't let it stay
Kills more each day
Amputate me
Tear it all away
Pick up the pieces
There is a better way
Put yourself together
Try to make a change
This world's so twisted
You can still make a change
Protect and care for the whole world
Stop the spread of hate
You feel like the broken one
Over and over again
You taste blood, you're through, you're done!
Only you can make it end (Over and over again...)
Pick up the pieces
