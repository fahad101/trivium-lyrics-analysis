And the Earth begins to shake
A cacophony of roaring
Anxiety growing
Cheers to leaving this mortal life behind
Sweat begins to downpour
A riot we stand for
The blackout foreshadows the chaos
So raise your voices with me
And sing this song of unity
So raise your hands up with me
And hold this moment eternally
Like a rift open in the sky
Through fire pulses a lightning
While thundering sounds ring
Tempting us to leave life's troubles behind
It's time to stick together
It's just so much better
Than life could ever offer
