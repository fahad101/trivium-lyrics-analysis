Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs, corrupt policy's decision
That's the sound of integrity breaking its back
In a country founded as a thievery act
Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs corrupt policy's decision
Times are dark with our children spoon-fed ignorance
Inheritance of an anxious trigger finger
Raise the guns at every self-made suspicion
Build the bombs corrupt policy's decision
Our leaders preach, if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy
Ignition, inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
Ignition, inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
Time again for a war on an enemy that isn't real
Greedy selfish warlords
Feed the agenda; death's the meal
That's the sound
Impending fear crawling up your spine
In a country, where nothing is truly made clear
Raise the guns at every self made suspicion
Build the bombs corrupt policy's decision
Our leaders preach if we disagree
We're the traitors of society
Homophobia, racism, sexism
Our systems breed supremacy
Ignition, inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
Ignition, inception
Burning is a fuse to destruction
Break the walls of ignorance
To disarm the world for its last chance
