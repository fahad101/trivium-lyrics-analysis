I was so empty, self-loathing
Before you awoke me, lived in transgression
Feasted in sin, destroying all I stood for
A world of spreading disease
We suffer infidelity
They force-feed on their stiffened sickness
The prophets hiding their rage
Just sucked out some of the pain
They take this world into lovelessness
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
In arms, we'll turn away
From their ways
We'll live like no other
Together, we're hope
Absolute
The only thing that matters
A world of spreading disease
We suffer infidelity
They force-feed on their stiffened sickness
The prophets hiding their rage
Just sucked out some of the pain
They take this world into lovelessness
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
All the pain in this world won't stop us now
For we have each other
All the hate in this world can't tear us apart
This love is forever
