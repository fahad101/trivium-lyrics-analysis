You hide behind barricades
Built of faades, you think you're safe
But someday we all will find you
Come to where you work
And fucking tie you
Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands
A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this
Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life (mess with my life)
I'll mess with your blood
And bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions
Obsess as each second fades
In denial of your mind-made
Still, your jealousy precedes you
You're really in love
With all that I do
Every lie
Shoved back
Down your throat
By our hands
A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this
Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life (mess with my life)
I'll mess with your blood
And bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions
This is to the rats
This is to the rats
This is to the rats
This is to the rats
And your conscience
Still tears at you
You secretly
Want to be just like me
A skull fuck
For every word
Just try to breathe
Don't fuck with this
Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life (mess with my life)
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deceptions
Break every bone in your face
If you mess with my life (mess with my life)
I'll mess with your blood
Bury you in a coffin made of your
A coffin made of your deception
