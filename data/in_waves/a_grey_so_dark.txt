Ripping out the feelings used to
Hold me in to place
Breaking through the structures
I unfold at my disgrace
I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown
A grey, a grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills again
A grey, a grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the end
Swallowing the ashes of a newly
Burned down dream
Tasting only charred remains of
Cured and better me
I'm digging deeper
To lay my misery down
Into the water
So that it may drown
A grey, a grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills again
A grey, a grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the end
I burst, not bleed
I'm pulled into the undertow
I burst, not bleed
I'm swallowed by the great below
A grey, a grey so dark
It moves in silence and kills again
A grey, a grey so dark
I lose myself and embrace the end
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
(Still blinding me)
A grey so dark
