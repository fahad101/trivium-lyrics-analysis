Take away all of this pain
Life feels like it's all in vain
Life feels like it's all in vain
Blindingly it seeps through the trees
Burning lots of conscious streams
Falling like dismantled dreams
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were never meant to make it this far
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were never meant to make it this far
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
We are all damaged and broke
Like to sing for death alone
Like to sing for death alone
Hope has gone cold with it's cause
Lost inside it's every flaw
Life has finally swallowed raw
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were never meant to make it this far
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
Uncovered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays
With the end in sight
I glimpse what's left of light
Pressing against my head
And dream of the color red
With the end in sight
I glimpse what's left of light
Pressing against my head
And dream of the color red
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
Uncovered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays
I feel the rage
And it burns the pages
Of all these yesterdays
Uncovered fast
In the falling ashes
Of all these yesterdays
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We are too far gone
We were never meant to make it this far
