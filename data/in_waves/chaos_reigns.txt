I built these wings
I built these wings with broken things
With broken things found strewn in me
Found strewn in me, my nemesis
My nemesis
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
I break and bleed
I break and bleed, I tear, then feed
I tear, then feed, the wretchedness
The wretchedness
The wretchedness inside of me
Inside of me, inside of me
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
I know where my hate truly hides
Front and center behind these eyes
Chaos
Reigns
It bites and holds
It bites and holds with fangs, so old
With fangs, so old, that loathsomeness
That loathsomeness, so bitter cold
So bitter cold
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
Chaos reigns
