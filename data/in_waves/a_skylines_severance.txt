I am disintegrating
As I set fire (set fire)
To the life that I once knew
In my last stand (last stand)
To break free (to break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
Dying seemed appropriate
For the old me (old me)
Living was so much harder
Lone and longing (longing)
To break free (to break free, to break free)
From the ghost of me (ghost of me)
I burn it down (burn it down, burn it down)
A past life to the ground, to the ground
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
It hurts so much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown
It hurts so much to feel alive
To feel the tide
Breaking down, these waves will drown
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
A skyline's severance
Cleave from creation's hands
