You are the cancer spreading its wings
So selfishly unaware to the things
Resistance is fuel into my well-being
I feel my heart leaking
(You!) Start as a fissure, a crack in the skin
(You!) Become an ulcer permeating
If I had known about you to
Would it be soon, what I do to you?
I don't want to hate you, but how could I not?
You killed off so much I held dear in my heart
Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
You're built to fall!
It's getting harder and harder to breathe
Choking on the same air as the walking disease
You are the thing that's killing me
From the inside out, let me be
I don't want to hate you
But you killed off everything in my heart
Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end
You've got your war against my head
Push that button, make it end!
Take away every single pain (single pain!)
That infects each and every day (everyday!)
I will bury you once and for all
You're a monster, you're built to fall
(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fall
(You're built to fall! You're built to fall!)
You're built to fall
