Your kingdom built on lies
Revenge I fantasize
Take heed all who oppose
You thought I was disposed
You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poisonous treachery
My judas masked the blame
But now you say that I-
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Your throat an open grave
Your tongue used to deceive
With that I'm sinking in
Your kind will never win
You've shown your true intentions
What kind of man you are
The knives are sharpening
A co-conspiracy
Poisonous treachery
My judas masked the blame
But now you say that I-
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Breathe in the flames
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
The walls that build you up
They burn you down the same
Burn you down the same
