She'd rather let the ocean take her inside its wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you dont fight
Slowly sinking to the bottom of the sea
I contend that there's no oxygen, since she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you dont fight
Rise, rise above the tides
Don't allow yourself to give up on life
Were lost forever
Lost together
Were lost forever
Lost together
She'd rather let the ocean take her inside its wake
Let the water fill her lungs like the air she hates to breathe
Now lost at sea
Find the strength to be
The waves will pull you down, underneath tonight
Rise, rise above the tides
The waves will pull you under if you dont fight
Rise, rise above the tides
Don't allow yourself to give up on life
