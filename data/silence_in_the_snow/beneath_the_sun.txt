The sun beats down
Crushing me below its bounding weight
Save me now
Everything is lost inside the storm
I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out
Ive come undone, beneath the sun
Im not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Don't fade away
The sky falls down
Cutting out the headstones made of sand
Save me now
Lead me from the temptations of man
I, burn from the inside out
I, look from the inside out
Ive come undone, beneath the sun
Im not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Don't fade away
Im burning inside
Theres no place left to hide
The world I once knew
Has been turned to ashes
(Turn and run forever) Im burning inside
(And ever) Theres no place left to hide
(On and on the world must burn)
(And as the ashes, we return to dust)
Ive come undone, beneath the sun
Im not the same
When all is lost, at any cost-
Don't fade away
