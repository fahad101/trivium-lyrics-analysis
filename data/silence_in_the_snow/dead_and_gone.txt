A fear of dying, a forgotten man
Just a number, a grain of sand
Time wont heal, its running out on me
All your pain, its more than I could take
What still rages
Will you keep fighting when Im gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone
I hope to die with no regrets
To leave a man, no one forgets
Time wont heal, its running out on me
All your pain, its more than I could take
What still rages
Will you keep fighting when Im gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone
Bearing down, bearing down on me(Dead and gone)
The weight of all my insecurities
Closing in, closing in on me
The walls collapse, I'll never face the pain
What still rages
Will you keep fighting when Im gone
What still rages
Will you keep fighting when Im gone
Through the ages
Will you keep fighting, when I am dead and gone
Dead and gone
Dead and gone
