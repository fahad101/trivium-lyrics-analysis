The Devil is in the details
This story is one of betrayal
Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right
You are the thing thats killing me
You're poisoning
You are the thing thats killing me
Now Im here to bury thee
Set fire to the empire
While growing fat off this world
Ungrateful, unworthy
You are the undeserving
No honor, no valor
No fucking gratitude
You are the wrong that I must right
You are the thing thats killing me
You're poisoning
You are the thing thats killing me
Now Im here to bury thee
You are the thing thats killing me
Now I can see
You are the thing thats killing me
You're poisoning
You are the thing thats killing me
Now Im here to bury thee
