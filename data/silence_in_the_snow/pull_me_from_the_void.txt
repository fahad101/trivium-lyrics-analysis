As I descend, I see the end
Its reaching up to pull me in
The bowels of Hell, a prison cell
Its decorated with my sin
I smash the shackles, God above me
Your world is toxic, now sink and let me be
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness you'll find yourself in time
As I ascend, enough defend
My reasons that I must avenge
A dying dream, unspoken thing
I clean myself of you, Im free
I smash the shackles, God above me
Your world is toxic, now sink and let me be
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness you'll find yourself in time
Revelation
Revelation
Revelation
Pull me from the void
Trapped beneath the tie of noise
Pull me from the void
Pathetic world I must destroy
Please pull me from the void
An uphill battle I must climb
So pull me from the void
From emptiness you'll find yourself in time
