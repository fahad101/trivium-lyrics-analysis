As I crawl through dirt and mud
Im sinking under
In a grave of life that was
I saw a light
I turned my back on everything
I searched for half-remembered dreams
Pulling me down with you
Above my head, they're circling
The vultures want whats left of me
I sacrificed it all and I will fight
Until the world goes cold
This battles burned all that Ive known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, Ill fight
Until the world goes cold
Until the world goes cold
As I build my house of bones
You're sinking under
For all your sins, you will atone
I burned it down
I turned my back on everything
I searched for half-remembered dreams
Pulling me down with you
(I burned it down)
Above my head, they're circling
The vultures want whats left of me
I sacrificed it all and I will fight
Until the world goes cold
This battles burned all that Ive known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, Ill fight
Until the world goes cold
This battle has burned all
Ill fight forevermore
Until the world goes cold
This battles burned all that Ive known
Until the world goes cold
This battles burned all that Ive known
Until the world goes cold
Nothing will keep me from this throne, Ill fight
Until the world goes cold
Until the world goes cold
Until the world goes cold
