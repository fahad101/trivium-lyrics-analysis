Losing, losing my faith in
The world that surrounds me
Am I, am I the only one
To constantly question it all?
So, So far away
Its ourselves that we betray
How has it come to this?
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
Blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyre falling
Down, you hear them calling
But its too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
Calling
Calling for action
I demand that you question
Are you
Are you content with the truth?
That they have fed down to you
Think
Think for yourselves
You must break out from this hell
How has it come to this?
We are but drones
Silenced, led amiss
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
Blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyre falling
Down, you hear them calling
But its too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
We must break
We must break free from this hell
We must break
We must break free from this hell
Bearer of light
Break down the walls
Remove the chains
Run towards the night
Blind leading the blind to the sea
Theyre drowning
Blind leading the blind to the edge
Theyre falling
Down, you hear them calling
But its too late for them
Now claim freedom
Save yourself
Just save yourself
Save yourself
