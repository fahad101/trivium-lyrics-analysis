Ghosts surrounding me, they're taking shape
I wake and see them standing there
What the hell (what the hell you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When your world (what the hell you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)
What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one
Save, save yourself
Its killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know Ill be the ghost thats haunting you
Apparition, read me my last rights
Cant read me into the grave
Quaint
What the hell (what the hell you supposed to do)
Are you supposed to do (when the whole world is after you)
When your world (what the hell you supposed to do)
Is coming after you (when the whole world is after you)
What have I done, what have I become
Standing six feet deep, am I the only one
Save, save yourself
Its killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know Ill be the ghost thats haunting you
(the ghost thats haunting you)
Save, save yourself
Its killing me to have to say
You know this is the only way
Save, save yourself
There's nothing left to say or do
You know Ill be the ghost thats haunting you
