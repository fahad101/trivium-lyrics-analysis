So you think you've won
Come take a walk inside
This enraged pissed off mind
It's calling for you
Feel Feel My Hatred
It bleeds down
On your faith
Lusted for so long
For the moment
Lying broken in a corner
Here it comes
Feel Feel your ending
It's so grim and cold here
How can this be for real?
I thought I already killed you
Ancient and immortalized
Will be my hate forever
For your kind
Human kind
