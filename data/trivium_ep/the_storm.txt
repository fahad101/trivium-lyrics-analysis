Out from the darkness my future is here
A frigid cold grips my veins
Foretold through ages beckoning fear
My nightmare's finally here
Time has now come look to the sun
A grand failure
The sky crumbles heavens follow
The end is here
Out from the endless hell frozen forest
I hear the ear piercing screams
Grey empty skies fill with black cancer
The beasts are coming for me
As I stand paralyzed consumed frozen by my fear
Sun falls reignite the end
The end
Now that it's over done with and gone
I reach cursing the sun
Blood thirsty warlords take to the sky
Icy plains graves here I die
As the pain rises up again
I question even being human
Absurd evil seared into mine eyes
Its here I forever die
Die
