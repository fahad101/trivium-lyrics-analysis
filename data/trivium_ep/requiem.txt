How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns alight the air
Fire of passion ignite
Open yourselves to fight
To reignite
The will
Deafening call
To kill
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this
Gazing at twilight's end
Arms raised chant extol
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream
If our world ended today would you suffer
Or just sit there awaiting damnation
How can you just stand there and stare?
The world burns alight the air
The structure of
Archetype
Abhorrence
To collapse all I've learned
To absorb with open eyes to see this
Revelation new serenity
Destruction disharmony
To see this
I'll wait for you
To rise from this dream
I will be waiting for you
To rise from this dream
