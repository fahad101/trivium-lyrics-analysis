A mind lost within its own self
Existing to
Feed its hunger
Your body hollowed empty shell
Awaiting feed
Of the ages
Darkness will cover the mind
Casting a shade
On reasoning
Immolation of the human self
Conflagration
Of the ego
Burn in your own hell
Life grand holding cell
Two become as one
One become a slave
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie
No longer are you human
Just a leech of
The addiction
Loathing 'til insanity
Mental deter-ioration
Burn in your own hell
Life grand holding cell
To destroy the faith
In humanity
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie
Life shell - shocks your empty shell
Hatred
For those privileged unlike you
You think you will win
But you can't
Face the
System of
Self
Destruction
Life
Skins mind bleeding dry
Hatred
For the self and the life
To destroy the faith
In humanity
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
Breathe in the life
Breathe in the lie
Burn the eye to blind
Keeping truth from mind
