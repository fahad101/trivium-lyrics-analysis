In time
You'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
Craft it
To how you see fit
Recognize powers you hold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away
Conformities shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been
To achieve
The victory
Is to set yourself free
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away
Conformities shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been
Burning Burning
Faster Faster
Are your revolutionists
If I could collapse the masses
We'd be free to grow our wings
In time you'll realize
That life is but a mold
To be one with the seas
Is to fly on broken wings
I swear by the blood I have shed
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away
Conformities shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have been
In this battle I still stand opposing
Burning away
Conformities shackles
To rely on the hand that still feeds you
Suffocates all that you could have
To set yourself free
