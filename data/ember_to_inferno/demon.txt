Pull the blood upon your face
Grip dementia
I am now enslaved through hate
Suffer my fate decide
Decide
Shot in their blackened tombs
Death burning my eyes
Invert birth great fiery womb
Time to ever die
Die
Feeling death consuming
Deaths head all around me
Feel death round
Feel death bound
Demons scream and pull me in
Look behold the flesh
Kingdom built of rotting skin
Enter gates of hell
Feel life die
Feel you die
