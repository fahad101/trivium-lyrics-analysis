In birth
Just an ember
A spark of creation
Towards genesis
With vision of dominion
And godliness
With vision

It will take
All you have held
In evolution's de-sign

All obstacles
Changing opposition to a carnal ash
With vision
Godliness
It will take
All you have held
Sacred

Godliness
Stay here 'til the windows
Stop burning for your dreams
'til the windows stop burning for your -
From ember to inferno
