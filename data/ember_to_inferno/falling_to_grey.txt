In this day
Aspirations star decayed
It was the light of our desires
A fire burns
In the mind
Torching once fundamental truths
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Self loathing
It's your state of mind
Drowning in dejection
Homicidal
Of your talents
It's mental suicide
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
One by one
They all drown
Down the path I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you
Buried dreams
Will wither dried
Sorrow is your guide
You haven't the will to carry on
You'll feel better when you're gone
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
One by one they all drown
Down the path I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you
If I may realign the scriptures
For fallacy's decay
Reclamation of the spirit
First step in taking back your life
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
Down (down)
Fall (fall)
One by one they all drown
Down the path I can't hear
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain with you
To feel this pain I'm falling to grey
To feel this pain with you
