In this chasm lying broken
Is a child
Charred inside
No more is there any hope
Shattered bones
Bloodied scars
De-liver me
Towards the soil
Close
Up the sun
Grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside
Of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in
What will never be
Prayed to be free
Broken on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
It's my only wish to die
Free myself
From your reign of terror
So many times swear I died
Why won't the blood loss
Kill me?
De-liver me
Towards the soil
Close
Up the sun
Grant me rest
In worms coil
It's so beautiful
World outside of this cell
With a somber gaze
I take in what will never be
Prayed to be free
Broken on my knees
God won't appear
When all light dies
Make me swear
If I see your face
Again
I'd make you pay
For the years
Of abuse
Fuck you
Tie you up
Make you bleed
Tear you apart
Limb from limb
So many years
I've held this in
I want
To take your life
Make me swear
If I see your face again
Tie you up
Make you bleed
Just like me
