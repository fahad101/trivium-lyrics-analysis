I am but a fragment
The lesser part of something more
This division leaves me
Incomplete
I long for completion
To be reassembled; detached
I am the obsolete
Those who create for
Another's need
Will never revel
They'll only bleed
Surrounding encumbrance
Coerced habitation with those
I cannot stand to be near
Ironically scathing
This life that I work so hard for
Keeps me from what I need
Voracious packs
Only exist to feed
Off everything that
I have in me
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world
Descend downwards into
The dark
Are you not entertained by
The fall?
Only misery enthralls
All my sadness and pain
On display
It's the only way you'd ever
Need me
The only way you would
Believe me
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world
Broken world
You've broken me
Collapsing upon myself
The light burned out so very
Long ago
So long ago
It's plain to see
So watch as I spiral down
Collide and crash into the
Broken world
