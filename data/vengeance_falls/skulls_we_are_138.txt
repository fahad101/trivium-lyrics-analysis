The corpses all hanging headless and limp
Bodies with no surprises
The blood drains down like devil's rain
We'll bathe tonight
I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull
Demon I am and face I peel
See your skin turned inside out
'Cause I've gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall, 'cause
I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull
Collect the heads of little girls and
Put 'em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and
Put 'em on my wall
I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
In the eyes of tiger
Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android not a man
The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of tiger
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
We are one thirty-eight
