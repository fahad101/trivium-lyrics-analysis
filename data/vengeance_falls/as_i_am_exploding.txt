One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Every single day that I have to live with you
Is a struggle I no longer can get through
And every time I cast aside evil
It keeps on crawling back anew
You will never comprehend how it hurts to be
To be tormented by everything that I see
The violence I foresee permeates everything
I've become bound completely
I can't stand this suffering anymore
Why won't it end?
No one hears me, no one sees this war
Raging in me
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Can't imagine what it's like to be all of you
Living under a shroud of complacency
The world is worse than you ever could now
The truth would be the thing that killed you
What I could prevent all of your suffering
Indiscriminate absolute purging
Do I have what it takes to be shepherd for
Everything that I deplore
I can't stand this suffering anymore
Why won't it end
No one hears me, no one sees this war
Raging in me
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Life can't keep going on this way
I feel I'm lost inside my hate
My thoughts overtake me
They're killing me faster with each passing day
Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding
Slowly, I'm burning
Inside - imploding
World keeps on turning
As I'm exploding
