I say, betrayer
Swear I've given you so much
Naysayer
I watched as you just lapped it up
Unwilling
Addicted to be without dignity
A cheater
You thrive on lechery
I don't know what I expected
Was our time even real?
Your callous heart never seemed affected
Does a liar even know how to feel?
Unto you I proclaim "Creonte" shall be your name
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim

You're calculating
I know you know exactly what you're doing
Your selfishness your only cause
A fake
A farce
You had us all convinced
No guilt
No heart
No love
Your conscience held
Unto you I proclaim "Creonte" shall be your name
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
Time will not mend
All these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end
For you, my friend
Time will not end
All these mistakes have now
Brought forth the end
For you, my friend
I say, betrayer
A fake
A farce
(You had us all convinced)
No guilt
No heart
No love
Your conscience held
Unto you I proclaim "Creonte" shall be your name
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
Betrayer
I'll never be a victim for you
I'll never be your fool
I'll never be a victim
