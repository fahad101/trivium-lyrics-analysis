Ember To Inferno,Inception The Bleeding Skies,[Instrumental]
Ember To Inferno,Pillars Of Serpents,"""I'm alive!""""I'm alive!""Final words of a god left drowningBurned aliveBurned aliveScorch the angels out from the skiesBuilding up the walls to surround us inFrom a world built on sinBuilding up the strength for the releaseFrom a world corruptedTo be unseenWith the eyesFor it's the ground that we lie onOpen wideOpen mindNail your mouths shut it's this worldWasting lives awayConsume to fillingOnly wakingFor the feedingGive me spark to light the worldUp in flames reigniteA changing to better timesEnd this nowPillarsSerpentsMake it overGive me spark to light the worldUp in flames reigniteA changing to better timesEnd this nowSo no more are these dreams of angelsWashed away with the tears"
