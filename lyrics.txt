Forgive them father
For they not know
My gospel of greed
Is all for show

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps (x2)

Will you bless us
With your mysterious ways
Will you grace us
With your mysterious ways
Will you heal us
With your mysterious ways
Will you save us
With your mysterious ways

Forgive me father
Lust knows no bounds
I service my needs
On hallowed grounds

I'd be thrown into the fire
If they ever learned the truth
And the congregation weeps (x2)

Will you bless us
With your mysterious ways
Will you grace us
With your mysterious ways
Will you heal us
With your mysterious ways
Will you save us
With your mysterious ways (x2)
