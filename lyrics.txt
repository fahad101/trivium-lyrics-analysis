Indoctrinate
The uneducated with your
Scriptures of hate
Manipulation mastered - threat of pain
Dissimulate
Your true intentions with a
Fiction, ornate
Those who don't believe are all to blame

I'm beaten down
Will - taken away
I cannot face another day
I've lost my ground
Standing face to face
I'll never see my home again
There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race

Condemnation
Expelled at everyone that
You find different
Breeding the abhorrence that will lead to war
Masturbation
You utlize your slaves for
Decimation
A faith not of love, but of fear and gore

I'm beaten down
Will - taken away
I cannot face another day
I've lost my ground
Standing face to face
I'll never see my home again
There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race
Mask your cause
Killers we are
There is no hope for the human race

There is no hope for the human race
We are flawed
Searching for God
There is no hope for the human race
Mask your cause
Killers we are
There is no hope for the human race
