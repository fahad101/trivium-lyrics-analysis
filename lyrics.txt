I'll drown you in your legacy
Pulling you under, the black waves you've created
In the moonlight, your fighting for silver luster
Perhaps you can call this your baptism

Did you tell them it would bring them closer to God?
So that's how you can call this your baptism?

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all on down into the ground
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring

Heaven will never be a sight for you
What goes on in your crazed mind, madman clairvoyant?
You were supposed to provide guidance, protection
But it was violation you bestowed

Did you tell them it would bring them closer to God?
So that's how you can call this your baptism?

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all on down into the ground
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring

Held down, forced fucked
Raped of innocence
Shattering the cradle in the name of God

(solo)

I'll be the servant who drives purity through the heart
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring
I'll be the torch to burn it all on down into the ground
And there's a filter you need so our sin is all we bring

Pound the nails through with teeth and skin
I'll leave you to die choking on your blood
Choking on your blood!
